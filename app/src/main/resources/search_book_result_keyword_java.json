The third edition of <i>Java in a Nutshell</i> covers Java 1.2 and Java 1.3 beta and includes:</p><ul><li>A description of the syntax of the Java language, written in a tight, concise style, that can serve as both a fast-paced tutorial and a language reference.</li><li>An explanation of the object-oriented features of Java that does not assume any prior object-oriented programming experience.</li><li>An overview of the essential Java APIs that shows how to perform common tasks, such as string manipulation, input/output, and thread handling, with the classes and interfaces that comprise the Java 2 platform.</li><li>Documentation for the Java development tools shipped with Sun's Java SDK.</li></ul>This book also includes O'Reilly's classic-style, quick-reference material for all of the classes in the essential Java packages, including <i>java.lang,</i> <i>java.io,</i> <i>java.beans</i><i>java.math,</i> <i>java.net,</i> <i>java.security,</i><i>java.text,</i> <i>java.util,</i> and <i>javax.crypto</i>.  This reference material covers all of the new classes in Java 1.2 and 1.3. Once you've learned Java, you'll keep this book next to your keyboard for handy reference while you program.This book is part of the two-volume set of quick references that every Java programmer needs.  It is an essential companion to <i>Java Foundation Classes in a Nutshell,</i> which covers the graphics and graphical user interface APIs in the Java 2 platform, including Swing, AWT, and Java 2D.  A third volume, <i>Java Enterprise in a Nutshell,</i> focuses on the Java Enterprise APIs and is of interest to programmers working on server-side or enterprise Java applications.</div>\n\n<p><br>\n\n<i>Amazon.com Review</I><br>\nThe 3rd edition of the well-known reference, <I>Java in a Nutshell</I>, covers the essential APIs of Java 1.2, including networking, security, input and output, and basic language and utility classes. Due to the size of the Java 1.2 API, graphics and graphical user interface classes are now examined in a volume called <I>Java Foundation Classes in a Nutshell</I>, and server-side and enterprise programming are detailed in <I>Java Enterprise in a Nutshell</I>. <p> Though primarily a reference, the book starts off with a thorough, fast-paced introduction to Java, exploring all the key topics, including syntax, object-oriented programming, security, beans, and tools. These discussions are brief and very information-dense, and if you are buying this book to learn the language, you will probably be overwhelmed by the speed of this initiation. <p> This book intends to document quite a bit of Java, and it easily succeeds with broad coverage of Java programming in Part I, and API cataloging broken down by package in Part II. For example, discussions in Part I explain Types, Reflection, and Dynamic Loading. The handling of these topics takes a little over a page, but the book gives a useful overview with code examples that clearly illustrate the points made. It is one of the clearest and most concise treatments of these three topics available. <p> The chapters in Part II include an introduction, diagrams, and sections for each class in the package. The sections for each class can be very informative, as in the discussion of the Socket class in the java.net chapter, which includes how to instantiate a Socket object, getting I/O streams from the object you instantiated, and how to alter the behavior of sockets. This discussion, like most in this book, is brief, clear, and to the point. <p> If you are looking for a Java reference, this is a solid volume that will provide lasting value. <I>--John Keogh</I><p> <B>Topics covered</B>: Part I, \"Introducing Java,\" provides broad coverage of Java programming topics, including data types, syntax, classes, and objects; Java file structure; inner classes; interfaces; packages; creating and initializing objects; destroying and finalizing objects; input/output; cryptography; networking; security; threads; JavaBeans; JavaDoc; and tools that come with Java 1.2 SDK. <p> Part II, \"The Java API Quick Reference,\" includes chapters on the following Java packages: java.beans, java.beans.beancontext, java.io, java.lang, java.lang.ref, java.lang.reflect, java.math, java.net, java.security, java.security.acl, java.security.cert, java.security.interfaces, java.security.spec, java.text, java.util, java.util.jar, java.util.zip, javax.crypto, javax.crypto.interfaces, javax.crypto.spec, and a final chapter, which provides an index for classes, methods, and fields.\n\n",

The author of the bestselling<i>Java in a Nutshell</i> has created an entire book of example programs that you can learn from and modify for your own use.  If you learn best \"by example,\" this is the book for you.This book is a companion volume to <i>Java in a Nutshell</i>.  While<i>Java in a Nutshell</i> is a quick-reference at heart, it also includes an accelerated introduction to Java programming.  <i>Java Examples in a Nutshell</i> picks up where that book leaves off, providing a suite of example programs for novice Java programmers and experts alike.  This book doesn't hold your hand or supply detailed explanations of Java syntax or method calls; it simply delivers well-commented working examples that help you explore the wide range of what is possible with Java 1.1. Each chapter concludes with programming  exercises that suggest further avenues for building on what you have learned.<i>Java Examples in a Nutshell</i> contains all of the example programs  from the first edition of <i>Java in a Nutshell</i>, completely updated  for Java 1.1.  In addition, the I/O, networking, and GUI chapters have  been augmented to include even more practical examples. It also expands  on the examples from the second edition of <i>Java in a Nutshell</i> that  demonstrate the new features in Java 1.1, including the new AWT event  handling model, the JavaBeans API, internationalization, object serialization,  and reflection.In addition, this book provides never-before-published programming examples  for remote method invocation, database connectivity, and security -- important  elements of the Java Enterprise APIs.

With over 150 expert examples that illustrate a wide  range of Java APIs, this volume definitely can bring your knowledge of Java to  the next level.<p>  Many programming titles rely on code excerpts to illustrate key programming  concepts. This book reverses that approach by emphasizing the code itself,  enhancing it with introductory material and explanations. While some short  examples illustrate simple algorithms (such as random-number generation and  sorting), many of the examples are substantial: for example, how to create a  multithreaded Web server, a proxy server, and even a simple Web browser (by  using built-in Swing classes for a user interface). These longer examples occupy  several pages; generally, they're well-commented models of coding clarity.<p>  This second edition adds extensive support for the Java 2 JDK 1.3 standard.  Later sections provide sample code on most recent developments in enterprise  APIs, including Swing, JDBC, and XML. This text concludes with one of the best  short tutorials that you're likely to find anywhere on JSP and servlet  programming, including excellent detail on deploying JSP-based Web  applications.<p>  Although it's designed to be a companion title to  <I>Java in a Nutshell</I> and  other O'Reilly Java offerings, there's little doubt that this book stands on its  own quite well. And, given the short exercises at the end of every chapter that  help you expand your command of Java features and APIs, this is a worthy and  up-to-date resource for all levels of Java programmers. <I>--Richard  Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B><table cellspacing=\"7\"  border=\"0\"><ul><ol><tr><td><li>Library of Java 2 code samples <li>A \"Hello  world\" example <li>Mathematical calculations and algorithms (the Fibonacci  Series, factorials, prime-number generation, sorting, exception handling)  <li>Basic class design (classes for graphics, random numbers, and a linked list)  <li>Java file I/O (including opening, reading, and writing files) <li>Filtering  file streams <li>Java threads and multitasking techniques <li>Java networking  classes (URLs and connections, sending e-mail) <li>Sample code for custom Web  servers and proxy servers <li>Security and cryptography <li>Basic  internationalization <li>The Java reflection APIs <td><br><td><li>Object  serialization <li>Swing user-interface design <li>Code for a simple Web browser,  based on Swing <li>Tutorial for AWT and Java 2-D graphics <li>Printing  techniques <li>Cutting and pasting data in Java <li>JavaBeans (custom  components, bean property editors, customizers) <li>Applet basics (including JDK  1.0 event handling and JAR files) <li>Remote Method Invocation (RMI) <li>Sample  code for a Multiuser Domain (MUD) server <li>Database and JDBC programming  <li>Servlet and JavaServer Pages (JSPs) tutorial <li>XML and Java (including  JAXP, SAX 1 and 2, and JDOM)</ol></ul></table>\n\n",

        "description": "<i>Product Description</I><br>\n<p>A few years ago, the hype surrounding applets put Java on the map as a programming language for the Web. Today, Java servlets stand poised to take Java to the next level as a Web development language. The main reason is that servlets offer a fast, powerful, portable replacement for CGI scripts.The Java Servlet API, introduced as the first standard extension to Java, provides a generic mechanism to extend the functionality of any kind of server. Servlets are most commonly used, however, to extend Web servers, performing tasks traditionally handled by CGI programs. Web servers that can support servlets include: Apache, Netscape's FastTrack and Enterprise Servers, Microsoft's IIS, O'Reilly's WebSite, and JavaSoft's Java Web Server.The beauty of servlets is that they execute within the Web server's process space and they persist between invocations. This gives servlets tremendous performance benefits over CGI programs. Yet because they're written in Java, servlets are far less likely to crash a Web server than a C-based NSAPI or ISAPI extension. Servlets have full access to the various Java APIs and to third-party component classes, making them ideal for use in communicating with applets, databases, and RMI servers. Plus, servlets are portable between operating systems and between servers -- with servlets you can \"write once, serve everywhere.\"<i>Java Servlet Programming</i> covers everything you need to know to write effective servlets and includes numerous examples that you can use as the basis for your own servlets. The book explains the servlet life cycle, showing how you can use servlets to maintain state information effortlessly.  It also describes how to serve dynamic Web content, including both HTML pages and multimedia data. Finally, it explores more advanced topics like integrated session tracking, efficient database connectivity using JDBC, applet-servlet communication, inter-servlet communication, and internationalization.</p>\n\n<p><br>\n\n<i>Amazon.com Review</I><br>\nThis book is a superb introduction to Java servlets and their various communications mechanisms. It includes deep and comprehensive coverage of the Java Servlet API, and also of HTTP, non-HTTP socket communications, Remote Method Invocation (RMI), and more. Throughout, the authors present excellent illustrative code and go to much effort to explain why things work the way they do.<p> The authors (to their credit) do not assume that Java programmers will be familiar with transport protocols or what really goes on when a Web server operates. They begin by showing how to use servlets to generate static pages, then show how to get servlets to generate customized documents in response to requests from the client side. That alone will satisfy many readers' problems. However, the authors go on to tell how to track sessions with servlets, how to carry out secure transactions, how to get servlet threads to communicate with each other, and more. If it can be done with Java servlets, it's discussed in this book. <I>Java Servlet Programming</I> also includes a reference to the Java Servlet API, version 2. <I>--David Wall</I>\n\n",

Used well, it can add hugely to the functionality and  interactivity of Web pages, and is almost universally supported by  browsers. Unlike Dynamic HTML, JavaScript is a language in its own  right but, until recently, there was no fully agreed standard. Instant  Javascript is the first book to deal with this emergent standard:  ECMAScript, it also goes into detail on the various compatibility  problems with existing browser implementations of JavaScript, as well  as looking at stand alone JavaScript\n\n<p><br>\n\n<i>Amazon.com Review</I><br>\nJavaScript is a powerful way to extend HTML content and work with Java applets, but developing with this language can be tricky. With this one-volume reference, you can begin using scripts within Web pages and also learn some of JavaScript's high-end features.<p>Early sections treat JavaScript as just another programming language, detailing data types, operators, and basic keywords. Then the book turns to the nuts and bolts of script development inside Web pages, featuring advanced topics you might not find elsewhere, such as the possibility of running JavaScript scripts on the server.<p>Further chapters explain how to get to browser objects from JavaScript, describing windows, forms, and event handling. There is also a good introduction to manipulating Java applets and Netscape plug-ins (such as Shockwave) with JavaScript. But some of the best chapters teach you how to use browser cookies within Java and offer debugging tips from the author. (JavaScript is legendarily difficult to debug, and the author has a number of potentially helpful suggestions here.)<p>Final sections show JavaScript at work with dynamic HTML. The reference material at the end of <i>Instant JavaScript</i> gives a handy listing of JavaScript fundamentals and HTML tags, making this book useful as both a tutorial and a place where JavaScript developers can get answers.\n\n",

It covers the building blocks (Servlets, JSP, EJB, JDBC, RMI, JNDI, CORBA) then goes into special design considerations for server side programming, (including resource pooling and component based design) before finally discussing future possibilities opened up by Jini and JavaSpaces technology.    <P>In a world where, increasingly, corporate IT development is Web application development - ASP, PHP, CGI and ISAPI are all viable options.Now, so is the Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition, and that's good news because server-side Java is portable across Windows, Linux, UNIX and MacOS and compatible with a wide range of Web Servers (IIS, Apache, Netscape Enterprise Server) and Application Servers from Sun, IBM and others.    <P>What does all this mean for you?  Java provides technologies to allow for server side processing,   dynamic page content generation and dynamic presentation.  With these comprehensive, platform independent Java class libraries you can join together the disparate pieces of your business - data, applications and platforms - to form a coherent whole.    <P>Java 2 Enterprise Edition - announced by Sun in June 1999 - makes Java an entire platform, not just another language and this is the first book that seriously covers it.\n\n<p><br>\n\n<i>Amazon.com Review</I><br>\nWrox specializes in books written by programmers, for  programmers. <I>Professional Java Server Programming</I>, a volume on  developing Java-based Web applications, is no different. All the 12  authors are developers and consultants--including some who've been  part of Sun's own Java team.<p> The Web is becoming more and more a  way of delivering applications rather than just static Web pages. Java  is becoming more and more popular as a tool for building Web  applications, thanks to Java servlets and Java Server  Pages. <I>Professional Java Server Programming</I> is a big book full  of code samples and real-world experience. <p> Starting with a  grounding in Web application development and technologies, the book  introduces the various concepts of using Java to deliver Web  content--as well as helping to give you the tools you need to work  around the limitations of Web servers and Web browsers. You'll also  learn how to develop complex database-driven applications--and how to  work faster. Since this is a book on the cutting edge of Java  development, you'll also find sections on using Java with XML  documents and LAP directory servers, as well as Enterprise Java  Beans. There's even a good examination of the next generation of Java  technologies--Jini and JavaSpaces--with a look at how these can be  used in Web applications.<p> This is a superb and extremely practical  book.

Prior to the  development of ASP and other earlier scripting solutions,  such as Sun's Java, Netscape's JavaScript, and Microsoft's  VBScript, all information served to the client's browser  was static -- the Web server did not dynamically generate  any part of the site's content. ASP allows Web developers  to dynamically generate browser-neutral content.</p><p><i>ASP in a Nutshell</i> provides the high-quality  documentation that developers really need to create effective ASP applications. It focuses on how features are  used in a real application and highlights little-known or  undocumented features as well. This book also includes an  overview of the interaction of the latest release of  Internet Information Server (version 4) and ASP, with an  introduction to the IIS object model and the objects it  comprises. The examples given in this section and  throughout the book are illustrated in VBScript.</p><p>This book is written for Web developers with an extensive  knowledge base and years of experience behind them. Like  other books in the In a Nutshell series, this book offers  the facts, including critical background information, in a  no-nonsense manner that users will refer to again and again.  It is a detailed reference that enables even experienced Web  developers to advance their ASP applications to new levels.</p><p>The main components covered in this book are:</p> <ul><li>Active Server Pages Introduction. Brief overview of the ASP application paradigm with examples in VBScript. Also an introduction to Microsoft's Internet Information Server  4.0, the IIS object model, and the objects that it comprises.</li> <li>Object Reference. Each object is discussed in the  following manner: descriptions, properties, collections,  methods, events, accessory files/required DLLs, and remarks,  including real-world uses, tips and tricks, and author's  experience (where applicable). The objects: Application,  Response, Request, Server, Session, ObjectContext, as well  as ASP Directives, Global.ASA, and SS Includes all follow  this paradigm.</li> <li>Component Reference.

After an introduction to ASP, author A. Keyton Weissinger rapidly reviews the progression of content from static form to the Internet, covering CGI, ISAPI, and ASP 2.0. The author clearly explains how ASP works and how server-side components can work with ASP code to further extend server-side functionality.<p> The core of the book is the object reference for ASP coding. Six chapters document all the key programmable ASP objects and each includes an area on Comments/Troubleshooting, Properties Reference, Methods Reference, and Events Reference and offers further explanatory text where necessary. Weissinger uses frequent, brief coding examples to illustrate each important topic. He closes the middle section of this book with details on pre-processing directives and the Global.ASA file.<p> The last part of the book discusses ActiveX Data Objects, NT Server Collaboration Data Objects, and a number of server components (such as the Ad Rotator, Content Rotator, My Info, Page Counter, and Permission Checker) in depth. <I>ASP in a Nutshell</I> provides a concise but detailed breakdown of all key ASP coding topics. <I>--Stephen W.

Horton then explains streams, files, and threads before getting  into the graphical stuff, where he details how to build attractive,  functional user interfaces with the Swing components (with solid  coverage of the Java 2 event model). Later chapters address Java2D  graphics and database connectivity. The author treats object  orientation as integral to the rest of Java programming, which is  appropriate to the language.<p> Readers get to see how concepts work,  as regular Try It Out sections include illustrative code listings and  the resulting output.

Part I begins with an in-depth look at the technology, and how its relevant to the NT administrator. This material is not an overview, but more preparatory material for real-world administration. Part II goes into the real nuts and bolts of thin client administration, covering such relevant issues as installation, configuration, network connection, management, and application distribution. Part III covers the most difficult issues involving thin client administration. This book addresses the real world issues you face, on a case-by-case basis, with tools and advice on solving them.</HTML>\n\n<p><br>\n\n<i>Amazon.com Review</I><br>\nDespite the heavy pro-Windows and anti-Java biases of author Ted Harwood, <I>Windows NT Terminal Server and Citrix MetaFrame</I> proves once again that entries in the New Riders networking book series are not to be missed. Both knowledgeable and pragmatic, Harwood capably guides you through all aspects of Terminal Server and MetaFrame, from market background to installation to application.<p> Divided into three parts, not including the appendices, this book begins with an overview section. Within the overview, the author draws the distinctions and overlaps between thin clients, Windows terminals, and Net PCs and explains the situations in which such solutions make sense. In addition, chapters are devoted to the architectural differences between Terminal Server and Windows NT Server 4 as well as Citrix MetaFrame. These pages are particularly important, as they outline the features inherent to the product--such as automated local device redirection and the ability to allow non-Windows clients to access Terminal Server--and whether or not it is appropriate for your network situation.<p> Part 2 deals exclusively with installation, configuration, and administration. This section showcases some of the book's best features, such as real-word tips and top 10 lists. The last section of the book delves into implementing real-world solutions in a Terminal Server/MetaFrame environment. Topics covered include remote access, incorporating non-Windows clients, load balancing, and application publishing. <I>-Sarah L. Roberts-Witt</I>\n\n",

In this book, you'll learn EJB from a developer's perspective---the author cuts through the marketing hype and shows you both the good and the bad in developing real-world EJB applications. You'll learn everything you need to jumpstart your EJB development, --from understanding the basics of the EJB architecture, to developing transactional, scalable, and secure multi-user enterprise applications.

Mixing a high-level perspective on EJBs with plenty of practical programming advice, this title makes a good choice for the IS manager or developer planning to use EJBs in future projects.<p> This book succeeds in two notable ways. First, it presents a fine high-level overview describing EJBs and how they fit into today's multitiered, server-side enterprise architectures. The author makes connections between EJBs and other component architectures (such as Microsoft DNA and CORBA). Illustrated with numerous diagrams, these chapters will be useful to anyone seeking to understand the basics of Sun's powerful component model.<p> This title also serves as a programming primer for serious EJB development. In later sections, the author introduces practical advice for creating both session and entity beans, with plenty of nuts-and-bolts advice, including how to work with actual EJB products. (This book also shows you what to look for when purchasing an EJB application server to deploy your bean components.)<p> Later chapters delve into transaction management and show how to use Java with CORBA and IIOP. The text culminates in an impressive case study using EJBs and Java servlets to power an e-commerce Web site (complete with an online catalog and a shopping cart). This example is a standout, and it's all you will likely need to get started with EJBs in custom projects. Final appendices cover several APIs and standards in more detail, including RMI, JNDI, and XML.<p> In all, this title succeeds at bringing the EJB standard home to the practical  reader.

The first volume deals with \"fundamental\" Java programming. Geared toward the more experienced programmer who has a knowledge of some other programming language, this guide is full of tips and smart enhancements to help you get the most out of basic Java.<p>Early chapters provide the history of Java and the basics of using it for Internet computing. The authors dutifully cover the bare-bones essentials of Java, such as variables, programming statements, and the basic object design in Java and argue that it is a good (though not perfect) object-oriented programming language. They include helpful suggestions for modeling classes using inheritance and interfaces. Some expert material, which makes use of several advanced language features, is also included in the discussion of how to clone arrays. Later the authors show how to use Java's inner classes, including anonymous inner classes. The chapter on graphics programming is also geared toward real-world programmers, showing how printing can be integrated alongside code that displays graphics on the screen.<p>The rest of the book moves toward the fundamentals of Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) programming, first covering the complexities of event handling in the Java Developer's Kit (JDK) 1.1 event model, then publishing a survey of the basic AWT components. The discussion of the \"peer,\" or native, model and how it can be bypassed easily using \"lightweight\" controls in JDK 1.1 programming is interesting. Concluding chapters describe the basics of processing applets; data structures, such as vectors and hash tables (as well as custom linked lists and queues for the more ambitious programmer); and exception handling.<p>The organization of this text makes a lot of sense for new--and more experienced--programmers who are making the transition to Java. This book covers a lot of ground while delivering a good deal of \"expert mode\" programming knowledge along the way.

Instead of covering a laundry-list of features, this book concentrates on what's really important, keeping your attention with short, clever examples, many of which use names and examples drawn from pop culture or historical trivia.<p> The first week of lessons in the book comprises an easily digestible tutorial on basic Java, with review questions and exercises that will help you start using it on your own. Next comes a tour of the various options for building user interfaces in today's Java, including Swing applets and applications. Besides basic component programming, you'll learn graphics using the new Java 2D API. (The older Abstract Windowing Toolkit, AWT, isn't covered.) Material on threading, animation and sound helps you explore Java's multimedia capabilities.<p> The third and final week of lessons addresses advanced Java APIs and features which extend the reach of Java on the enterprise. After delving into more advanced class design, the book looks at topics like I/O streams in Java and object serialisation (which allows objects to work with streams). Chapters on security and basic networking (illustrated using a server that generates trivia questions for clients) will let you work with Java on the Internet. The book closes with a chapter on database programming with JDBC. (There's also coverage of the older JDK 1.0 collection classes, a little surprising given the focus on newer Java 2 standards elsewhere.) <p> In all, <I>Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days</I> provides an efficiently packaged tutorial for learning Java, one that will be appreciated by any beginning Java programmer. The sheer number of classes and APIs in today's Java can be overwhelming. The intelligent and concise series of lessons in this book will help jump-start your knowledge. <I>--Richard Dragan</I> \n\n",

JSP uses a component-based approach that allows web developers to easily combine static HTML for look-and-feel with Java components for dynamic features. The simplicity of this component-based model, combined with the cross-platform power of Java, allows a web development environment with enormous potential.<i>JavaServer Pages</i> shows how to develop Java-based web applications without having to be a hardcore programmer. The author provides an overview of JSP concepts and discusses how JSP fits into the larger picture of web applications. Web page authors will benefit from the chapters on generating dynamic content, handling session information, accessing databases, authenticating users, and personalizing content. In the programming-oriented chapters, Java programmers learn how to create Java components and custom JSP tags for web authors to use in JSP pages.</p>\n\n<p><br>\n\n<i>Amazon.com Review</I><br>\nThis comprehensive guide to JavaServer Pages (JSPs), a fast-growing technology for Web developers, teaches you how to embed server-side Java into Web pages, while also offering full access to other features such as JavaBeans, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), and JDBC database access. The reference JSP implementation is the freely available Apache Tomcat server, so it won't cost a thing to get started. All the example code in the book has been tested on Tomcat, in fact.<p>  The first part of <I>JavaServer Pages</I> covers the essentials of HTTP and Java Servlets, on which JSPs are based. There is also a guide to installing Tomcat on your Windows or Unix system. The next part, aimed at Web page designers as well as programmers, covers JSP application development. There is material on scripting elements, error handling, managing user sessions, database access, security, and using XML and XSL with JSP. Part 3, for programmers, broadens the scope to include EJB and other Java components, developing custom tags, and achieving highly scalable applications using database connection pools. A comprehensive reference section finishes things off.<p>  The author has been an active participant in the official servlet and JSP working groups, and this book is both well informed and well organized. It provides experts with invaluable tips and insights, while newcomers will find all they need to assess and implement their first JSP applications. <I>--Tim Anderson, Amazon.co.uk</I>\n\n",

It allows you to create dynamic, interactive Web-based applications that run completely within a Web browser; you don't have to do any server-side programming, like writing CGI scripts.JavaScript is a simpler language than Java. It can be embedded directly in Web pages without compilation, so it is more flexible and easier to use for simple tasks like animation. However, although you can write reasonably robust and complete Web applications using JavaScript alone, JavaScript is not a substitute for Java. In fact, JavaScript is a good client-side complement to Java; using the two together allows you to create more complex applications than are possible with JavaScript alone.<i>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</i> provides a thorough description of the core JavaScript language and its client-side framework, complete with sophisticated examples that show you how to handle common tasks, like validating form data and working with cookies. The book also contains a definitive, in-depth reference section that covers every core and client-side JavaScript function, object, method, property, constructor, and event handler. This book is an indispensable reference for all JavaScript programmers, regardless of experience level.This third edition of <i>JavaScript: The Definitive Guide</i> describes the latest version of the language, JavaScript 1.2, as supported by Netscape Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 4. The book also covers JavaScript 1.1, which is the first industry-standard version known as ECMAScript. The new features of JavaScript 1.2, which are likely to be embodied in a later ECMAScript standard release, are clearly indicated, so that you can use them as appropriate in your scripts.</p>\n\n",

This is the JavaScript book for the rest of us. Written by the author of the \"JavaScript Tip of the Week\" Web site, this book focuses on the most useful and  applicable scripts for making truly interactive, engaging Web sites  (and it doesn't proclaim to be the definitive all-knowing JavaScript guide).You'll not only have quick access to the scripts you need, you'll  finally understand why the scripts work, how to alter the scripts to  get the effects you want, and, ultimately, how to write your own  groundbreaking scripts from scratch. Through his popular Web site,  Nick Heinle has been showing Web designers and other nonprogrammers how  to create the scripts they need. In fact, he wrote much of the JavaScript  used on the Web today. This book is the culmination of his work. His  explanations are clear, detailed, and accessible; everything -- every  script, every concept, every line -- is explained so that \"the rest of us\"  will understand.<i>Designing with JavaScript</i> covers many of the powerful capabilities that  JavaScript is given with Dynamic HTML, in a few chapters covering important aspects of implementing Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 as  well as Netscape Navgigator 4.0. You'll learn how to create pages on  the fly, how to identify users' browsers, how to create \"rollover\" effects  with sound, graphics, and animation, and more. It also features a CD-ROM  and Web site that provide fast access to some of the author's most useful functions and scripts, making it easy to find the code you need and to build your own custom scripts.</p>\n\n<p><br>\n\n<i>Amazon.com Review</I><br>\n<i>Designing with JavaScript</i> is an excellent learn-by-example tutorial that helps you create dynamic content for your Web site. Each chapter tackles a single topic with a relaxed and conversational tone. The thoroughly explained examples in each chapter are blocked off in green for quick reference and included on the accompanying CD-ROM. Whiz-kid author Nick Heinle--author of the JavaScript Tip of the Week Web site and closet high school student--covers a lot of ground, from dynamic frames, forms, and cookies to the latest in both 4.0 browsers' versions of Dynamic HTML. One excellent chapter demonstrates how to easily include multiple versions of your scripts to work with versions of Netscape Navigator or Internet Explorer, depending on which browser views the page.<p> This is one the best titles available for relative newcomers or Web designers who want to get waist-deep in scripting as quickly as possible. However, Heinle's examples will also be useful to anyone with an interest in JavaScript.\n\n",

The only downside to the book is that it's kind of hard to explain all of the API functionality without assuming a minimum level of competence from the audience. For that reason, this book might be a bit intimidating to novice programmers, but it really rewards you if you put time into it and tinker with things.<p> The book also works well as a source of ideas and inspiration for when you have to write your own server modules, and I'd recommend it if you want to customize your Apache server or speed up your Perl CGI programs. <I>--Doug Beaver</I>\n\n",

But how do you cut through all the hype and actually put it to work? Java  revolutionized the programming world by providing a platform-independent  programming language. XML takes the revolution a step further with  a platform-independent language for interchanging data. Java and XML  share many features that are ideal for building web-based enterprise  applications, such as platform-independence, extensibility, reusability, and  global language (Unicode) support, and both are based on industry standards.  Together Java and XML allow enterprises to simplify and lower costs  of information sharing and data exchange. <i>Java and XML</i> shows how to  put the two together, building real-world applications in which both the  code and the data are truly portable.This book covers:</p><ul><li>The basics of XML</li><li>Using standard Java APIs to parse XML</li><li>Designing new document types using DTDs and Schemas</li><li>Writing programs that generate XML data</li><li>Transforming XML into different forms using XSL transformations (XSL/T)</li><li>XML-RPC</li><li>Using a web publishing framework like Apache-Cocoon</li></ul>This is the first book to cover the most recent versions of the DOM  specification (DOM 2), the SAX API (SAX 2) and Sun's Java API for XML.</div>\n\n<p><br>\n\n<i>Amazon.com Review</I><br>\nTwo hot topics come together in this developer's guide from Brett  McLaughlin, <I>Java and XML</I>. Both Java and XML are cross-platform  technologies; by using Java for code and XML for transporting data, you can  build truly portable applications. This title is aimed at intermediate to  advanced programmers; while XML topics are explained more or less from scratch,  readers will need prior knowledge of Java.<p>  The book begins with an overview of XML and its uses, and goes on to explain how  to parse XML by using the Simple API for XML (SAX 2). Next, there is coverage of  how XML is validated by using Document Type Definitions (DTDs) and XML Schema,  and transformed by using eXtensible Stylesheet Language (XSL). Brief coverage of  Sun's Java API for XML is followed by a detailed look at the Java Document  Object Model (JDOM), a new API devised by the author in association with  O'Reilly, the publisher. <p>  The last part of the book is more advanced, and covers applications of XML and  Java. There are chapters on Web-publishing frameworks, XML Remote Procedure  Calls (RPCs), using XML to read and write configuration data, and generating XML  with Java. There is also a short business-to-business example. Appendices  provide an API reference to the various specifications discussed in the book.<p>  The strengths of <I>Java and XML</I> include the author's deep knowledge of his  subject, and a writing style that is both clear and enthusiastic. If you happen  to know a lot about Java and not much about XML, this is the ideal title.

The reason is clear: Spring is a lightweight Java framework in a world of complex heavyweight architectures that take forever to implement. Spring is like a breath of fresh air to overworked developers.In Spring, you can make an object secure, remote, or transactional, with a couple of lines of configuration instead of embedded code. The resulting application is simple and clean. In Spring, you can work less and go home early, because you can strip away a whole lot of the redundant code that you tend to see in most J2EE applications. You won't be nearly as burdened with meaningless detail. In Spring, you can change your mind without the consequences bleeding through your entire application. You'll adapt much more quickly than you ever could before.<i>Spring: A Developer's Notebook</i> offers a quick dive into the new Spring framework, designed to let you get hands-on as quickly as you like. If you don't want to bother with a lot of theory, this book is definitely for you.  You'll work through one example after another. Along the way, you'll discover the energy and promise of the Spring framework.This practical guide features ten code-intensive labs that'll rapidly get you up to speed.  You'll learn how to do the following, and more:</p><ul><li>install the Spring Framework</li><li>set up the development environment</li><li>use Spring with other open source Java tools such as Tomcat, Struts, and Hibernate</li><li>master AOP and transactions</li><li>utilize ORM solutions</li></ul>As with all titles in the Developer's Notebook series, this no-nonsense book skips all the boring prose and cuts right to the chase.

        "description": "<i>Product Description</I><br>\nIn this book, a team of Sun engineers presents the first start-to-finish guide to enterprise application development with the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE). This book covers every component of J2EE, providing \"best practices\" principles for building secure, high-performance multi-tier enterprise applications, plus a detailed case study showing exactly how to get the job done. The authors begin with an insider's overview of the J2EE platform, and how it can be used. They review each key component, platform, service, and communication technology provided by J2EE; then walk through enterprise development one tier at a time, showing how to leverage J2EE most effectively. The book covers each area: the client tier, Web tier, Enterprise JavaBeans tier, and Enterprise Information System tier, as well as practical techniques for packaging and deployment; extensive coverage of transactions, plus details on the J2EE security model. With the launch of the J2EE Platform, this book is the ideal one-stop resource for IT managers, web providers, EJB developers, database administrators, system administrators and system integrators.\n\n<p><br>\n\n<i>Amazon.com Review</I><br>\nWith its excellent cross-platform capabilities and rich enterprise-level  APIs, today's Java 2, Enterprise Edition (J2EE), stands ready to build the next  generation of multitiered Web applications--but architecting these solutions can  be a daunting task. Written by the experts at Sun, <I>Designing Enterprise  Applications with the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition</I> provides the  official \"blueprint\" for building scalable, server-centric applications by using  Java. This title is perfect for any manager or developer seeking to get a handle  on the \"right\" way to design distributed applications by using Java.<p>  This text bundles together separate chapters written by various members of the  Sun \"Enterprise Team.\" The prominent methodology here is the consistent use of  the model-view-controller (MVC) paradigm for designing the server-side tiers. In  MVC, data (model) is kept separate from its presentation (view), and the two  are coordinated through a controller class. The book uses quite a few useful  architectural diagrams, which show how to combine Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs),  servlets, and JavaServer Pages (JSPs) effectively. Managers or project leaders  who might not code with Java everyday might learn from these diagrams how Java  components work together within Web applications. Also, the authors explain the  Sun \"vision\" for Java for a variety of e-commerce scenarios (including several  business-to-business systems).<p>  Separate chapters dig into the client, Web, EJB, and \"enterprise information  systems\" tiers, and where to use various J2EE APIs for the best scalability and  maintainability. Later sections look at deploying EJBs, as well as options for  transaction management and security for the enterprise. The authors close with a  complete Web application created with EJBs and servlets for an online pet store --a useful illustration of J2EE at work. All in all, this text is a valuable  tour of Sun's official \"vision\" for enterprise-level computing with Java. It  demystifies how various Java APIs can work together to create robust and  scalable Web applications. Any IS manager or developer designing with J2EE will  want a look at this book to learn how to take full advantage of the latest  features for Java-based Web applications. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> Overview of Java 2, Enterprise Edition (J2EE), for  enterprise application development, application scenarios (including stand-alone  clients, Web-based and business-to-business scenarios), J2EE components for  client-side and server-side tiers (including applets and Enterprise Java Beans  (EJBs)), platform roles for companies using Java, overview of Java APIs and  services: JNDI and naming services, deployment, transaction, and security  services, Java communication support: networking support, Remote Method  Invocation (RMI), OMG CORBA support, Java Message Service (JMS), and JavaMail;  building Web and EJB clients, the model-view-controller paradigm explained,  combining servlets, JSPs, and EJBs on the middle tier, using entity and session  EJBs, stateful and stateless session beans, sample applications for the  enterprise information systems tier (applications for an e-store, human  resources, and distributed purchasing), packaging and deployment, transaction  management (JTA, JTS, and EJB transactions), Java security overview, and a case  study and sample code for an e-commerce pet store.\n\n",

        "description": "<i>Product Description</I><br>\nRather than a simple update of the existing Professional Java Server Programming book, the J2EE edition represents an evolution of the content to reflect the changing state of server-side Java development. Whereas the first edition can be seen as an introduction to Java on the server, the new edition is a more tightly integrated vision of how to combine the Java technologies to develop n-tier applications in Java based primarily around J2EE. Since the release of the first edition in the fall of '99, probably the single most significant change in the Java server-side landscape has been the release of the Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE). Although we covered many of the elements of J2EE in the first edition of the book, many things have changed.<P> <P>J2EE represents a serious attempt by Sun to make Java not just a viable language, but more importantly a viable platform for enterprise development.

Written by  over a dozen experts, this new edition of <I>Professional Java Server  Programming</I> provides a truly massive and authoritative guide to the latest  standards and APIs that are available in J2EE. This title is a must-have for anyone who's  serious about enterprise development in Java.<p> Weighing in at over 1,400 pages, <I>Professional Java Server Programming</I>  provides a wide-reaching resource of all of the APIs that are required for J2EE  development that centers on servlets and JSPs for creating UIs and Enterprise  JavaBeans (EJBs), XML, and JDBC for getting to data on the server. Besides being  a practical guide to how to combine these standards (with plenty of useful  examples of these APIs in action), it also delivers a healthy dose of the design  philosophy that's recommended by Sun for building scalable and robust enterprise  Web applications.<p> Throughout, this text does a good job of merging theory with practice. Almost  every chapter has a useful working example that shows how APIs work, with sample  code for such Web applications as an e-commerce shopping cart, tech support  pages, and a front end for a manufacturing database. The core of this volume is  its treatment of servlets and JSPs for building Web-based front ends in Java.  This new edition also highlights EJBs in excellent detail, with a thorough tour  of designing, programming, and deploying EJBs effectively. (There's also notable  coverage of the emerging EJB 2.0 standard, which adds several important  features, like a query language for more powerful database access.)<p> The practical focus here is reflected also in chapters that are devoted to  debugging, testing, and deploying J2EE applications--critical issues for any  aspiring enterprise developer. While no single book can make you an expert, this  one can get you started with a superb tour of the APIs and technologies that  you'll need to tackle large-scale development in Java. <I>--Richard  Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>Introduction to enterprise computing with the  Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) platform (technologies, APIs, architectures;  development roles) <li>Introduction to RMI (including security, parameter  passing, and distributed garbage collection) <li>JDBC tutorial (including  prepared statements, updateable result sets, batch updates, connection pooling,  and distributed transactions) <li>JNDI and LDAP <li>XML basics (including XML  parsers, XSLT, and CSS) <li>Servlet tutorial (servlet APIs, the servlet life  cycle, requests and responses, and maintaining session information) <li>Shopping  cart servlet example <li>JavaServer Pages (JSPs) tutorial (directives, scripting  elements, custom tags, and tag libraries) <li>JSP coding standards <li>Using JSP  and XML together <li>JavaMail <li>Enterprise JavaBeans (EJBs) tutorial <li>EJB  containers <li>Design guidelines for EJBs <li>Session and entity beans  <li>Container vs. bean-managed persistence <li>New EJB 2.0 features (including  the EJB 2 0 Query Language) <li>Sun's Model-View-Controller architecture for  designing enterprise-level applications <li>Performance and scalability hints  <li>Debugging and testing techniques <li>The Java Message Service (JMS) and  message queuing <li>Integrating J2EE with CORBA <li>Deploying J2EE  applications</ul>\n\n",

It has been acclaimed for its clear and personable writing, for its extensive use of examples, and for its logical and complete organization. The third edition of the book maintains and improves upon all these qualities while updating the material to cover the latest developments in the Java language - such as using Java Foundation Classes, Java 2D Classes, and JavaBeans.\n\n<p><br>\n\n<i>Amazon.com Review</I><br>\nNewly revised for some of the latest Sun JDK 1.3 standards, the second edition of <I>Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days</I> provides a refreshingly compact and useful tour of Java suitable for anyone who wants to master this powerful programming language quickly.<p>  Currently, Java has some 2,000 classes and over 24,000 methods and properties. Instead of covering a laundry list of features, this book concentrates on what's really important, and keeps your attention with short, clever examples, many of which use names and examples drawn from pop culture or historical trivia. <p>  The first week of lessons in the book comprises an easily digestible tutorial on basic Java, with review questions and exercises that will help you start using it on your own. Next comes a tour of the various options for building user interfaces in today's Java, including Swing applets and applications. In addition to basic component programming, you'll learn graphics using the new Java 2D API. (The older Abstract Windowing Toolkit, AWT, isn't covered.) Material on threading, animation, and sound helps you explore Java's multimedia capabilities.<p>  The third and final week of lessons addresses advanced Java APIs and features that extend the reach of Java on the enterprise. After delving into more advanced class design, the book looks at topics like I/O streams in Java and Object Serialization (which allows objects to work with streams). Chapters on security and basic networking (illustrated using a server that generates trivia questions for clients) will let you work with Java on the Internet. The book closes with a chapter on database programming with JDBC. (There's also coverage of the older JDK 1.0 collection classes, which is a little surprising given the book's focus on newer Java 2 standards.)<p>  All in all, <I>Sams Teach Yourself Java 2 in 21 Days</I> provides an efficiently packaged tutorial for learning Java, one that will be appreciated by any beginning Java programmer. The sheer number of classes and APIs in today's Java can be overwhelming. The intelligent and concise series of lessons in this book will help jump-start your knowledge. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p>  <B>Topics covered:</B> <ul><li>Overview and history of Java <li>Introduction to objects <li>Class inheritance <li>Tutorial for basic Java (including data types and keywords, flow control, and working with objects) <li>Arrays <li>Basic Java applications <li>Methods and constructors <li>Introduction to Java applets <li>Building Swing user interfaces (basic component types, layout managers, and event processing) <li>Java 2D graphics (drawing basic shapes, text output, and fonts) <li>Using threads for animation <li>Loading and displaying images <li>Java Sound (including MIDI files) <li>Advanced class design (interfaces, packages, advanced method options) <li>Exception handling and security <li>Signing JAR files <li>File and stream I/O in Java <li>Object Serialization and reflection <li>Remote Method Invocation (RMI) <li>Java networking basics (sockets and servers) <li>Building custom UI components with JavaBeans <li>Database programming with JDBC <li>JDK 1.0 collection classes <li>References on the Sun JDK 1.3 (including installation)</ul> \n\n",
